# 🧠 Tyler AI Logic Solver - SAT + SMT Dashboard

An interactive symbolic reasoning platform built from the ground up using Python, Z3, and Flask — designed to help visualize and understand formal logic, SAT problems, and SMT solving in a creative and educational way.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔁 **3-SAT → 2-SAT Clause Reduction**  
  Breaks down 3-literal clauses into logically equivalent 2-literal clauses using symbolic transformations.

- 📊 **Implication Graph Visualization**  
  Generates directed graphs of variable dependencies for 2-SAT logic using Vis.js.

- ⚙️ **Tseitin CNF Transformation**  
  Converts logic formulas to conjunctive normal form (CNF) using symbolic auxiliary variables.

- 🧠 **Z3 SMT Integration**  
  Uses Z3 to reason about boolean satisfiability, symbolic constraints, and halting conditions.

- 🤖 **Turing Machine Simulation**  
  Encodes and simulates bounded-step Turing Machines to study symbolic halting behavior.

- 🧩 **Collatz-Inspired Reductions (Tyler's Theory)**  
  Reduces symbolic logic clauses using iterative transformations inspired by the Collatz function.

- 🌐 **Web Dashboard (Flask + JS)**  
  Full UI for exploring logic, solving, reducing, and visualizing symbolic structures in real-time.
